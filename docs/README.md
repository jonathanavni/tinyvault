# docs

Project documentation lives here. Two kinds:

- **Methodology (permanent):** [`handoff-pattern.md`](handoff-pattern.md) — how the orchestrator hands work off to the adversary. Read it before any Codex handoff.
- **Planning docs and draft specs (per-project):** the detailed design for an in-flight workstream, draft specifications, and design records — where the "how" for a planned piece of work lives, before and during implementation.

When a planning doc or spec is superseded or shipped, move it to [`archive/`](archive/) rather than deleting it. The history is useful, and a stale doc at the root is more confusing than an archived one. `/wrapup`'s doc-hygiene check surfaces docs that look superseded but haven't been moved.

<!-- Index your active planning docs here as you add them, e.g.:
- `migration-plan.md` — design for the v2 schema migration (active)
- `archive/old-auth-design.md` — superseded by the session-token approach
-->
