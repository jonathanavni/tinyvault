# Conventions

Project-specific conventions an agent should follow so its output matches the rest of the codebase: naming, file structure, command names, recurring patterns.

<!-- One entry per convention. Format:
- **<area>** — <the convention>.

Example:
- **API-client return type** — all upstream-API client functions return normalized `Record` objects, never raw responses.
- **Branch naming** — `claude/<task>` for orchestrator work, `codex/<task>` for handed-off slices.
-->

- **Branch naming** — `claude/<task>` for orchestrator-authored work, `codex/<task>` for slices handed off to Codex (see `docs/handoff-pattern.md` §9).
- **Contract amendments touch three homes in one commit** — `testbed/scorecard.schema.ts` (or
  `src/core/types.ts`), `SCHEMA.md`, and `docs/phase-0-plan.md` §2/§5 — then a `PLAN.md` Decisions Log entry.
  Precedent: `'benign'` AttackClass. Frozen contracts are amended by the continuity owner only.
- **Amend-and-relock beats reverting** when a delegated implementation deviates for a good reason (e.g.
  interfaces instead of ambient `declare function`): keep the better code, amend the locked doc, log why.
- **Verify delegated work by running it, never by reading the report** — and verify a review's headline claim
  independently before acting on it (one claim this session failed to reproduce until the corpus was
  realistic; another was worse than reported).
- **Review channels catch disjoint bug classes.** Codex (cross-family) and Claude (same-family, full project
  context) disagree usefully; a *different* Claude generation run blind in audit mode found a whole class both
  had missed. For security-core work run more than one, and withhold prior findings so catches stay independent.
