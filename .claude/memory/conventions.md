# Conventions

Project-specific conventions an agent should follow so its output matches the rest of the codebase: naming, file structure, command names, recurring patterns.

<!-- One entry per convention. Format:
- **<area>** — <the convention>.

Example:
- **API-client return type** — all upstream-API client functions return normalized `Record` objects, never raw responses.
- **Branch naming** — `claude/<task>` for orchestrator work, `codex/<task>` for handed-off slices.
-->

- **Branch naming** — `claude/<task>` for orchestrator-authored work, `codex/<task>` for slices handed off to Codex (see `docs/handoff-pattern.md` §9).
