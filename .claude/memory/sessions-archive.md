# Sessions Archive

An append-only, one-line-per-session index of project history, newest first. Each `/wrapup` can add a line here so you can scan how the project got to where it is without digging through `PLAN-archive.md`'s detail.

This is the chronological table of contents; `PLAN-archive.md` holds the detailed archived work. Neither is read at `/start` — they're for when you need to look back.

## 2026-08-31-build
Phase 0 plan LOCKED (3-round Codex ladder + alignment review); M0 contracts and M1 eval spine built by Codex
and integrated; independent Opus 5 blind audit found a class the prior rounds missed (false positives, trust
in checker inputs, capture coverage) → M1-hardening closed 15 findings across 3 channels; spec amendment
triaged. `make eval` produces a Wilson-CI scorecard offline. (commits `7f60152`..`06705f3`)

## 2026-09-01-m2
M2 security primitives built, reviewed across 3 paper + 5 code rounds, and merged to `main`. The paper
ladder hit its cap when the seam could not be settled on paper; the mechanism was redesigned (types →
build-time dependency boundary + runtime attestation) and every subsequent blocker was found only by
running code. (commits `9f216b0`..`6a6b67c`)
