# PLAN Archive

Full detail of completed or no-longer-load-bearing work, moved out of `PLAN.md` so its Current State stays lean. Reviewed every `/wrapup`: anything no longer needed to understand current/next work lands here as a short, dated summary.

This file is for historical context. It is never read at `/start`.

## 2026-08-31-kickoff / 2026-08-31-phase0 (superseded by 2026-08-31-build)
Harness seeded into the repo; Phase 0 plan drafted and LOCKED after a 3-round Codex adversarial ladder
(15 findings) plus a fresh-context spec-alignment review (16 gaps). An orphaned earlier Phase 0 draft was
consolidated in and archived to `docs/archive/implementation-plan-superseded.md`. Full decision trail
remains in the `PLAN.md` Decisions Log (never archived); the locked plan is `docs/phase-0-plan.md`.
Commits `7f60152` (lock) through `f0c889e`.

## 2026-09-01-m2 — M2 security primitives (merged `6a6b67c`)

Built through the full 🔴 ladder and merged fast-forward to `main`. Three paper-review rounds
(NO-SHIP / NEEDS-ATTENTION / NO-SHIP, 22 findings) closed at the §5 cap when three findings all reduced to
*"TypeScript cannot enforce this"* — the mechanism was redesigned from type enforcement to a build-time
dependency boundary plus runtime attestation, and validation moved to code. Then five code-review rounds
across `/review`, `/security-review`, and Codex adversarial, each finding something real: a provenance
TOCTOU letting caller-controlled evidence reach the scanner, a taint clear with no capability, four
successive dependency-gate silent-disarms, and a load-bearing guard with no test. ~30 code findings
absorbed. Full trail in `docs/m2-review-findings.md`; decisions in the `PLAN.md` Decisions Log.
